# Day 1 Assignment: HTML Basics

## Task 1: Create Your First HTML Document
1. Create a new file named `index.html`
2. Set up the proper HTML document structure with:
   - DOCTYPE declaration
   - html element with lang attribute
   - head section with proper meta tags
   - title element with your name
   - body element

## Task 2: Add Content to Your Page
Add the following content to your page:
1. An `h1` heading with the text "About Me"
2. An `h2` heading with the text "My Skills"
3. A paragraph (`p`) introducing yourself
4. An ordered list (`ol`) with at least 3 skills you have or want to learn
5. An unordered list (`ul`) with your top 3 hobbies
6. An image (`img`) - you can use a placeholder image from [placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com)
7. A link (`a`) to a website that helps you learn coding

## Task 3: Organize Your Content
1. Create sections using appropriate HTML elements
2. Add comments to explain different parts of your code
3. Make sure your HTML is properly indented and readable

## Submission
Save your HTML file and open it in a browser to verify it displays correctly. Then run the test case to check your solution.

## Bonus Challenge
Add a table (`table`) that shows your weekly schedule with at least 3 rows and 3 columns.

## Example Output
Your page should look something like this when viewed in a browser:

```
